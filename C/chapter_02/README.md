### Exercise 02 
# 🌡️ Temperature Clothing Selector

## 📝 Description


A simple C program that recommends appropriate clothing based on the current temperature. (using condicionals);

## Features
- Takes temperature input from the user
- Provides clothing suggestions for different temperature ranges
- Simple and clear conditional logic

## 🔹 Key Concepts
- Conditional logic with `if-else if-else` statements
- Input handling with `scanf()`
- Basic program structure in C
- Temperature range categorization

## 🧠 What You'll Learn
- How to implement decision-making in C
- Understanding of logical operators in conditions
- Practical use of input/output functions
- Structuring code for readability

## Temperature Ranges
- Below 0°C: "Very Cold, wear a warm coat!"
- 0-10°C: "Cold, wear a warm coat, protect yourself"
- 10-20°C: "Cool, wear a light coat"
- 20-25°C: "Moderate temperature, wear a sweatshirt or light jacket"
- 25-30°C: "Warm weather, wear a t-shirt"
- 30-35°C: "Very hot weather, CAREFUL, stay hydrated"

## Exercise 03 – IMC Calculator

**📝 Description**  
A program that calculates the Body Mass Index (IMC) based on user input for height and weight, then classifies it using conditionals.

**⚙️ Features**  
- Takes height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) as input  
- Calculates IMC using the formula: `IMC = weight / (height * height)`  
- Displays classification based on IMC ranges (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight)

**🔑 Key Concepts**  
- Input handling with `scanf()`  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Conditional classification logic

## Exercise 04 – Average Grade Calculator

**📝 Description**  
A program that calculates the average of multiple student grades and determines if the student passed or failed.

**⚙️ Features**  
- Accepts multiple grades from the user  
- Computes the average  
- Uses conditionals to check if the average meets a passing threshold

**🔑 Key Concepts**  
- Conditional checks for pass/fail criteria  
- Basic arithmetic and user interaction
